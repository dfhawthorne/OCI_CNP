> OCI WAF is a cloud-based security service that aids in the protection of your web applications against malicious and unwanted Internet traffic. It employs a multilayered approach to help safeguard web applications against a variety of cyber threats such as malicious bots, application layer (L7) DDOS attacks, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities defined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). It can protect any Internet-facing endpoint by enforcing consistent rules across applications and filtering out malicious requests to your web application.
