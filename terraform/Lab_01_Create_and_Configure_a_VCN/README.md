# Lab 01: Networking - Virtual Cloud Network: Create and Configure a Virtual Cloud Network

## Overview

In this practice, you will configure and deploy a Virtaul Cloud Network (VCN).

A VCN is a software-defined network specific to your OCI tenancy or a compartment in a specific region.

Upon creation, a VCN automatically includes route tables, security lists (with default security rules) and a set of DHCP options. The VCN also has access to a DNS resolver.

A VCN that is launched with the OCI VCN Wizard tool automatically creates the following:

- Public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway (IG)
- NAT Gateway (NAT)
- Service Gateway (SG)
- Two Route Tables (RT)
- Two Security Lists (SL)

For more information on Virtual Cloud Networks, see the [OCI Networking Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/landing.htm).
